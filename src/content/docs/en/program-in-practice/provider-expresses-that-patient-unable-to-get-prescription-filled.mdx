    The patient may be eligible for Co-Pay Assistance through the ELIQUIS 360 Support program if they are not already enrolled.
    <h3 class="answer-title">Actions taken by the following may help address concerns:</h3>

<h4>Is this a CVS Caremark Value Plan/Zinc patient?</h4>
1. Did patient receive an ELIQUIS $10 Co-Pay Extend Card from their provider?
Did the patient activate the card by calling **[1-855-ELIQUIS](tel:1-855-ELIQUIS)**?
2. Pharmacist to trigger Prior Authorization (PA) for HCP to fill out before the
plan will provide coverage for ELIQUIS.
3. Is Pharmacist waiting for PA approval? Patient does not need to wait for
approval to have prescription filled unless mandated by the pharmacy.
4. Patients who already have an existing Co-Pay Card can continue to use it.
They should request a PA from their provider at next fill.

<div class="iconbox-wrapper">

</div>
<h4>How should ELIQUIS $10 Co-Pay Extend Card claims be processed at the pharmacy?</h4>
Pharmacists should be instructed to file claims in the secondary position with “OCC3*” or “OCC8*” when the primary rejects with rejection code 70 or 75.
<br />
<small>Note: There are “other coverage codes” common to this scenario, which are required in most
systems when filing the claim.</small>

<h4>Refer to hospital case manager</h4>
1. Did the patient receive a PAFTO, either printed or digitally via Virtual
Resource Program URL? Has the patient been informed what the copay
card is, how to enroll, and how to use it? Are weekend staff aware of
available resources and providing them to ELIQUIS patients at discharge,
as well as meds to beds program?
2. Was the patient prescribed a starter pack? Alternatively, the case manager
or discharge nurse has the option to add pharmacy instructions within the
EHR via an eRx note. The pharmacy can then dispense 74 pills if a starter
pack is not available.
3. The case manager can explain the benefit review process to help patients
understand their co-pay and assistance options.
